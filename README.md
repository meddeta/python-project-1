# string manipulation and control flow
Introduction
This Python project consists of four distinct tasks, each showcasing different aspects of Python programming. The tasks range from a BMI calculator to a leetspeak converter, a string manipulator, and a number extractor and multiplier. This document will guide you through the setup and usage of each task.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Basic knowledge of running Python scripts in a terminal or an IDE.
Installation
No additional libraries are required for this project. Simply clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Task Descriptions
Task 1: BMI Calculator
This script calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs for weight (in kilograms) and height (in centimeters). The program will also format the user's name to capitalize the first letter.

Usage
Run the script and follow the prompts to enter your name, weight, and height.

Task 2: Leetspeak Converter
The leetspeak converter takes a user-input string and converts it into leetspeak by replacing certain characters with numerals or other symbols.

Usage
Run the script and input the string you want to convert to leetspeak.

Task 3: Flipping String
This script takes a long string input, identifies the middle character, and then flips the string around this character. The output displays the length of the string, the middle character, and the flipped string.

Usage
Run the script, enter a long string when prompted, and the script will display the flipped string.

Task 4: Multiple Numbers
This script extracts two numbers from a string and multiplies them. It reads a string input, identifies numbers within the string, and outputs the product of these numbers.

Usage
Run the script and enter a string that contains two numbers. The script will extract these numbers and display their product.

Exiting the Program
To exit any task, simply complete its prompts. The final task (Task 4) ends with a prompt to press enter to exit.
